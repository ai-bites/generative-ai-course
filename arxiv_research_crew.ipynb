We present a transformer-based deep learning\\nmodel that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to\\nforecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic\\nseismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of\\nthe MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model\\nachieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the\\n15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty\\nestimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate,\\nuncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture\\npropagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of\\ndeep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide\\nmitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.', 'published': datetime.datetime(2025, 6, 17, 19, 10, 5, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), 'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14923v1', 'comment': None}, {'title': 'Foundation Artificial Intelligence Models for Health Recognition Using Face Photographs (FAHR-Face)', 'authors': ['Fridolin Haugg', 'Grace Lee', 'John He', 'Leonard Nürnberg', 'Dennis Bontempi', 'Danielle S.

We\\nbuilt FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and\\nfine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)\\nand survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).\\n  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on\\n749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of\\ncancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)\\nand independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were\\nclinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival\\nanalyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic\\nfactors.\\n  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error\\nof 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining\\naccuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge\\noutperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.\\nFAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the\\nhighest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest\\n(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the\\nindependent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,\\nrace and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary\\nprognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct\\nfacial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved\\nprognostic accuracy.\\n  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable\\nfacial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related\\nmortality risk.

However, most\\nexisting multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial\\nreasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to\\nmore complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional\\nreasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To\\naddress this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach\\nPeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy\\ndesigned to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving\\nlearning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce\\npermutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to\\nexplore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout\\nfiltering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute\\nmost to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We\\nevaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image\\nbenchmarks.
